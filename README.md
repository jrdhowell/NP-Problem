# NP-Problem

## NP Problem Coding Challenge

Coding challenge involving both solving an NP problem and dynamic programming.

Challenge:

Create a function solution(m) that takes an integer between 4 and 201 as an argument, and 
returns the number of unique combinations of positive integers that can be summed to equal the 
given integer. 

For example, if m = 5, the possible combinations are (1, 4) and (2, 3), therefore the function would return 2.
